# 🎪 GLASTLE ⛺

**The Game of Contemporary Performing Arts (Queue Simulator 2025)**

Welcome to the most realistic Glastonbury ticket buying experience ever created (minus the actual tickets).

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Join the Queue**: You are placed in a random position (usually behind 50,000 other people).
2.  **Refresh Strategically**: 
    *   🟢 **GREEN**: GO! Refresh now to move forward!
    *   🟡 **AMBER**: Risky... you might lose your spot.
    *   🔴 **RED**: STOP! Do not refresh or you'll be flagged as a bot.
3.  **Collect Power-ups**:
    *   💻 **New Computer**: Huge jump forward!
    *   🌍 **Good VPN**: Sneaky boost.
    *   🕵️ **Incognito Mode**: Smooth sailing.
    *   ⚠️ **Avoid Fakes**: Bad VPNs and New Tabs will increase your **Bot Risk**.
4.  **Don't be a Bot**: If your Bot Risk gets too high, you're banned.
5.  **Beat the Clock**: Tickets sell out in 2 minutes. Can you make it?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **React** (because queues need state)
*   **TypeScript** (for type-safe disappointment)
*   **Vite** (faster than the actual queue)
*   **Tailwind CSS** (styling the pain away)
